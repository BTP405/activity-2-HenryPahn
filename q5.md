**1. Describe what each program snippet does to compute its results.**
```
# Approach 1: 
def doubleL(n):
    res = []
    for i in range(n): res.append(i * 2)
    return res

for i in doubleL(5): 
    print(i, end=' : ')
```
In doubleL(n) function, it returns a list of results of doubling each integer from 0 to n 0 - 1 by using a normal for loop with range(n). Then it print the list out.

```
#Approach 2: 
for x in [n * 2 for n in range(5)]:
    print(x, end=' : ')
```
This approach uses list comprehension to generate a list of results of doubling each integer from 0 to n - 1. Then it print the list out.

```
#Approach 3: 
def doubleG(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i * 2

for i in doubleG(5):
    print(i, end=' : ')
```
In this approach, yield sends the value back to the caller same as return, but yeild let the called function resume where it left off while return will stop the function immediately. This approach is similar to approach 1, but we don't need temporary container to store values, we just yield the values back to caller.

**2. What type of function is `doubleG(n)`? What is the advantage of using such a function?** <br>
In Approach 3, the function doubleG(n) is a generator function. Generators provide effective memory use by producing a series of values one at a time using the yield statement. Using a generator function has the benefit of generating values dynamically rather than storing the full sequence in memory. Compared to methods that generate and store full lists in memory, this can be particularly helpful when working with huge datasets because it improves performance and uses less memory.
